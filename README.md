# Tunic Save Manager
Tool to manage the save files for the Tunic game

# Installation
The TunicSaveManager is a portable executable, which means it does not require direct installation on your PC.

# Usage
The tool will create snapshots of the current save files which can be loaded at any time.
To load correctly the save file, it is recomended to exit to the main menu, then load the desired snapshot with the 'TunicSaveManager' and finally load the save file manually in the game instead of selecting 'Continue'.
Sometime it is necessary to exit from the game to apply all changes succesfully. For example, after beating a boss, it may be requiered to exit the game if the save to load was previous to this boss fight.

The tool also provides a option to export/import all the save files created with the tool in order to share them. 
CAUTION: Importing files will delete all local save files.
